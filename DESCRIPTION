Description: An implementation of double generalized linear model (DGLM) building with variable selection procedures and handling of interaction terms and other complex situations. We also provide a method of handling convergence issues within the dglm() function. The package offers a simulation function for generating simulated data for testing purposes and utilizes the forward stepwise variable selection procedure in model-building. It also provides a new custom bootstrap function for mean and standard deviation estimation and functions for building crossplots and squareplots from a data set.
